This repository contains the Peer-graded assignments: \
\
**c1m1 Peer-Graded Assignment: Week 1 Application Assignment** \
This application includes statistical functions that can analyze an array of *unsigned* char data items and report analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean, and median of the data set. In addition, the data set is reordered from large to small. All statistics are rounded down to the nearest integer. After analysis and sorting is done, the data is printed to the screen. \
\
**c1m2 Peer-Graded Assignment: Week 2 Application Assignment** \
This assignment creates a build system using the GNU tools, GCC and GNU Make. The Makefile compiles multiple files, link them together and create a final output executable. Two platforms are supported; the host environment and the target embedded system MSP432. The host system allows execution on the host platform. The target system will be used to create our microcontroller applications. \
\
**course1 Peer-Graded Assignment: Week 4 Expanded Build System and Memory** \
This assignment reuses the version control repository from Week 1 and adds some new c-programming functions that manipulate memory. The code is tested on the host machine, but should compile for both the target platform and host platform.
