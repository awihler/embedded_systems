This application includes statistical functions that can analyze an array of unsigned char data items and report analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean, and median of the data set. In addition, the data set is reordered from large to small. All statistics are rounded down to the nearest integer. After analysis and sorting is done, the data is printed to the screen.
